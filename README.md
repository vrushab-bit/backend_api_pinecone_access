# Python environment with a requirements.txt

## Notes

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Rename .env.bak to .env and populate the required secrets

```
python run.py
```
